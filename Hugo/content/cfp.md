# Call For Papers

Modeling started out with UML and its precursors as a graphical notation.
Such visual representations enable direct intuitive capturing of reality,
but they have weaknesses: for example, detailed visual representations bear
the risk of becoming overcrowded faster than textual models and some of
the visual features lack the level of precision required to create complete
and unambiguous specifications. These weaknesses of graphical notations
encouraged the development of text-based modeling languages that either
integrate with or replace graphical notations for modeling. Typical examples
of such languages are OCL, textual MOF, Epsilon, and Alloy. Textual
modeling languages have their roots in formal language paradigms like logic,
programming and databases.

The goal of this workshop is to create a forum where researchers and practitioners
interested in building models using OCL or other kinds of textual
languages can directly interact, report advances, share results, identify tools
for language development, and discuss appropriate standards. In particular,
the workshop will encourage discussions for achieving synergy from different
modeling language concepts and modeling language use. The close interaction
will enable researchers and practitioners to identify common interests
and options for potential cooperation.

OCL 2022 will be part of the *25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering
Languages and Systems* ([MODELS 2022](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2022)).
This year, MODELS workshops share a common theme of "Modeling for social good".
Thus, we particularly encourage submissions considering the application of 
textual modeling to intelligent systems, and social/ethical issues.


## Topics of interest

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Mappings between textual modeling languages and other languages/formalisms
- Mathematical models and/or formal semantics for textual modeling languages
- Algorithms, evaluation strategies and optimizations in the context
  of textual modeling languages for:
  - validation, verification, and testing,
  - model transformation and code generation,
  - meta-modeling and DSLs, and
  - query and constraint specifications
- Alternative graphical/textual notations for textual modeling languages
- Evolution, transformation and simplification of textual modeling
  expressions
- Libraries, templates and patterns for textual modeling languages
- Tools that support textual modeling languages (e.g., verification of
  OCL formulae, runtime monitoring of invariants)
- Model-driven security using textual modeling languages 
- Complexity results for textual modeling languages
- Quality models and benchmarks for comparing and evaluating
  textual modeling tools and algorithms
- Successful applications of textual modeling languages
- Case studies on industrial applications of textual modeling languages
- Experience reports:
  - usage of textual modeling languages and tools in complex domains,
  - usability of textual modeling languages and tools for end-users,
  - applications of textual modeling in the lifecycle of intelligent systems,
  - applications of textual modeling with a positive impact on society
- Empirical studies about the benefits and drawbacks of textual modeling
  languages
- Innovative textual modeling tools
- Comparison, evaluation and integration of modeling languages
- Correlation between modeling languages and modeling tasks
- Reflections on the future trends of textual modeling languages 
  and their integrity with other software development technologies


## Submissions

Four types of submissions will be considered:

* Presentation only submission (not included in the workshop
  proceedings), e.g., for already published work. Authors should
  submit a short (1 page) abstract of their presentation.
* Short papers (5 pages) describing new ideas or position papers.
* Tool papers (5 pages) describing tools supporting
  textual modeling tools
* Full papers (between 7 and 10 pages).

All submissions should follow the [ACM proceedings template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
LaTeX users must use the provided ``acmart.cls`` and ``ACM-Reference-Format.bst`` without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., ``\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}``), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., ``\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}``).
Submissions should be uploaded to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ocl2022).

The program committee will review the submissions (minimum 2 reviews
per paper, usually 3 reviews) and select papers according to their
relevance and interest for discussions that will take place at the
workshop. Accepted papers will be included in a joint MODELS' 
workshop proceedings volume to appear in the ACM digital library.
